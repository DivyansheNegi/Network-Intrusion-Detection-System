# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
* This is a machine learning–based Network Intrusion Detection System designed to classify and detect cyber threats.  
* Developed using IBM Cloud and Watson Studio (Watson AI), it identifies network intrusions such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Probe attacks.  
* The project analyzes labeled network traffic data to distinguish between normal activity and potential security threats.
